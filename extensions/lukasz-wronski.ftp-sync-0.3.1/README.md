Please provide as much information as possible. We are dealing with diffrent ftp servers, file structures, file permissions, operating systems and it might be difficult to reproduce your error and fix it without detailed informations.

I'm looking forward to get any feedback from extension users! Contribution, especially on bug fixing is more than welcome!
